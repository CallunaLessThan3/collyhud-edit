# About
There won't be very many big changes, just some personal tweaks and hopefully fixes to stuff tf2 updates broke

## Implemented Changes
- Changed custom kill icons to [Better Consistent Kill Icons (2023)](https://gamebanana.com/mods/406361)
    - The ones provided were broken, unsure if that was a linux problem or not

## Planned Changes
### Bug fixes
- inventory
    - item details cut off
    - on loadouts, items details are too low z-level
- scoreboard
    - duels break kda
    - scrollbar exists on 12 player (not bug ? bothers me though)

### Personal Changes
- background for items on inspect
- health/ammo more centered
- medi charge % slightly under crosshair
- transparent background behind health on deathcam
- bigger target id (prob too much effort)
