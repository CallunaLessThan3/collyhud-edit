# About
There won't be very many big changes, just some personal tweaks and hopefully fixes to stuff tf2 updates broke

### NOTE
64-bit update broke some things, idk if its specific to my pc but here are things that broke for me after update
- Game crashes when using hud_reloadscheme in a match
- Any painted/festivized weapons art is transparent

## Implemented Changes
- Changed custom kill icons to [Better Consistent Kill Icons (2023)](https://gamebanana.com/mods/406361)
    - The ones provided were broken, unsure if that was a linux problem or not
- Scoreboard
    - Increased height of scoreboard slightly to remove scrollbar when 6 or 12 players
- Inventory
    - Item details were cut off in loadout item selection, increased width to fix
    - "View Valid Items" not formatted correctly, changed to match "View Entire Backpack"
- Centered Medic Ubercharge %
    - (this made vaccinator display rly shit but who uses that anyways)

## Planned Changes
### Bug fixes
- inventory
    - on loadouts, items details are too low z-level (couldnt fix)
- scoreboard
    - duels break kda (this might be intended)


### Planned Changes
- background for items on inspect
- health/ammo more centered
- bigger medic uber % on targetid (couldnt figure out how)
- update countdown pregame (?)
